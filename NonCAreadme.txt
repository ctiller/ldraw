                 NonCA-PARTS LIBRARY AGREEMENT
                        NonCAreadme.txt


1. Introduction

The following is the README text for the LDraw NonCA-Parts
Library NOT licenced by the Creative Commons Attribution
Licence 2.0 as specified by the LDraw Contributor Agreement
(CA). Parts which fall under the NonCA agreement will contain
the following line in their headers:

0 !LICENCE Not redistributable : see NonCAreadme.txt

However this text is not a licence! It is simply a handy
reference for understanding that these parts are only governed
by copyright, which means that LDraw.org was granted an exclusive
tacit approval to distribute them when the parts were submitted
to the LDraw Parts Tracker (or it's previous structure) for
certification. This text itself has no legal value. It is a
human-readable expression of some key terms since all rights
lay with the original copyright holders.

2. Rights

You are free:

   * to use the LDraw NonCA-Parts Library

You are NOT free:

   * to copy, distribute, and display the LDraw NonCA-Parts
     Library
   * to make derivative works to make commercial use of the
     LDraw NonCA-Parts Library

Any of these conditions can be waived if you get permission
from the copyright holder.

Your fair use and other rights are in no way affected by the
above.

3. Enforcements

The single copyright holders are the sole entity responsible
for enforcements of their copyrights. LDraw.org is the sole
distributor of these files. Since you are not free to make 
derivative works of NonCA-Parts LDraw.org considers the
following good rules of thumb to determine if a new file is
not a Derivative work. If in doubt contact the current LDraw
Steering Committee (SteerCo) or the single copyright holders.

What is not considered a Derivative work?

   * Rendered images generated from the LDraw NonCA-Part
     library. Rendering here covers any conversion of a 3D
     model file into a 2D image.

   * Model files containing references only (the source code
     for the part may NOT be included in any form) to parts in
     the official LDraw NonCA-Parts Library at the time of their
     creation. If the sole or main purpose (as determined by the
     LDraw SteerCo in consultation with the potentially offending
     author and LDraw community at large) of the Model file is
     to include large numbers of NonCA-Parts then it WILL be
     considered a derivative work.

   * Alternative libraries of parts which LDraw.org does not own
     or enforce the copyright. If some or more of the parts in the
     library are converted from the LDraw NonCA-Parts Library then
     they must be considered a Derivative work.
